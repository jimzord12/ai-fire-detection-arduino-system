- It seems that in normal circumstances in a open environment, the CO Sensor reads 50-150.

- When a human kindly exhales near the sensor, the reading spikes to around 350-550.

- This sensor seems to quite sensitive to human breath, likely due to the CO2 content in exhaled air. When closed the room, the readings starting to rise slowly over time, going from 100 to 140 after ~5 minutes and did not seem to stabilize. Also, the sensor is ~50-60cm away from the human source.
