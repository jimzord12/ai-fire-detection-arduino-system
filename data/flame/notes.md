# Flame Sensor Notes

It seems like that Flame Sensor needs to point directly at the flame source to detect it properly. Make sure there are no obstructions between the sensor and the flame, and try adjusting the angle of the sensor for better detection. Additionally, ensure that the sensor is powered correctly and that all connections are secure. If the problem persists, consider testing the sensor with a different flame source to rule out any issues with the current setup.

# Observations

- At 20cm distance, the sensor detects the flame reliably.
- At 10cm distance, the results worsen, possibly due to the sensor pointing below the flame.
- At 3cm distance, the results worsen even more.
- Ambient light conditions seem to affect the sensor's performance; testing in a darker environment may yield better results.
