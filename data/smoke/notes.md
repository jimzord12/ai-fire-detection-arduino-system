The Smoke Sensor seems to not be sensitive enough as the readings did not change significantly when the room was filled with smoke. Values were around 200-300.

However, when the Smoke Sensor was placed very close to the Smoke Source (~5cm), there was a noticeable increase in the readings, indicating that the sensor can detect smoke but requires proximity to the source. Values rose to around 600-850 in this scenario.

This suggests that while the Smoke Sensor can detect smoke, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the distance from the smoke source. For practical applications, it may be necessary to position the sensor closer to potential smoke sources to ensure reliable detection.
