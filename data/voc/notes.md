The VOC Sensor was the first to be tested in this environment.

We learned that the MEM Sensors if they have not been used for a while, they need some time to "warm up" and stabilize their readings. It seems that the warm up time is around 8+ hours.

Thus, the first readings were very stable regardless of the circumstances. The observed steady value of 250 give or take 15.

Generally speaking, we observed that after the long warm up time, the VOC sensor readings increased to around 450-700. Even with the VOC source absent, the readings did not seem to change much.

However, we noticed that the readings did changed, when we starting blowing the paper ball infused with alcohol lotion. The readings spiked to around 800-950 when the VOC source was 1cm away from the sensor and a human was blowing.

The VOC does not seem to very sensitive to the presence of the VOC source alone, unless there is some air movement to help evaporate the alcohol faster.
