For the Smoke Experiment, we used a 3 towel paper sheets, pressed them together to form a thicker material. The combined sheets took the shape of a sphere with a radius of ~5cm. This was our Smoke Source.

We conducted 3 scenarios to observe the behavior of smoke, all took place in a indoor room:

1. We took reading for 5 minutes with no Smoke Source.
2. We lit the Smoke Source using a lighter and took readings for 5 minutes, the sensor was ~10cm away from the source.
3. Using the existing setup from scenario 2, we placed the Smoke Sendor directly above the Smoke Source at a distance of ~5cm and took readings for another 5 minutes.
