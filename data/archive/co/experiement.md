# CO Experiment Setup

The environment is a small room. The ventilation can be controlled (open/close door and window).

The human observer is ~50-60cm away from the CO Sensor.

We used 9 tealights (small candles) arranged in a 3x3 grid as our heat sources.

Each tealight was placed in a small metal holder to ensure safety and stability. The tealights were lit and allowed to burn for a period of 5-10 minutes to ensure they reached a steady state of heat output.

The CO Sensor was positioned at a height of ~10 cm above and ~10cm away from the center of the tealight grid to effectively capture the CO emissions.
