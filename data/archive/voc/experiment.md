The environment is a small room. The ventilation can be controlled (open/close door and window).

We used small paper ball infused with alcoholic lotion of 95 percent pure alcohol to create a VOC source.

The 3\* scenarios tested were:

1. Open environment:
   1.1 no VOC source
   1.2 with VOC source 20cm away from the sensor
   1.3 with VOC source 1cm away from the sensor

2. Closed environment:v
   2.1 no VOC source
   2.2 with VOC source 20cm away from the sensor
   2.3\* with VOC source 1cm away from the sensor + _Human blowing air to help evaporate the alcohol faster_
